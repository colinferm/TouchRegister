# TouchRegister
A simple iOS program that puts a dot on the screen for each touch. Used to prove ghost touches at an Apple Store

This literally doesn't do anything more than leave a colored dot on the screen with a touch number. This is so that if an iOS device is registering ghost touches, they can be witnessed. Also, it has a little particle effect because... why not? and it draws the eye if the iPad and App are running next to you but you're not necessarily looking directly at it.

It also has a button to reset touches.

This is pretty much iOS 101. Nothing in this should make a developer scratch their head.
